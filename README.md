## Introduction

Made as part of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course on FreeCodeCamp.

### Course Aim

One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus 'A' ↔ 'N', 'B' ↔ 'O' and so on.

Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.


### Personal Aims

Succesfully solve the JavaScript challenge.

Convert the code from my completed challenge so that it works with a HTML page.

Improve my knowledge and understanding of JavaScript.

Have a project I can go back and refactor as I progress, for shorter code that's easier to understand.


## Technologies

- HTML5
- JavaScript
- CSS3

## Launch

Running this project locally should be nice and easy! Either download the repository from Github or use the viewer on Codepen.

### Prerequisites

None

### Running

Once you've downloaded and unzipped the repo file, simply open up the index.html in your browser.


## Built With

- Visual Studio Code

- Chrome Devtools

- FCC Console

I developed the JS code in on FCC for the challenge, then used VSC to amend it and add it to HTML.

## Author Notes

As with all the other projects I've completed on this course, my code is still fairly basic. It's not too long but I'm sure it could be shortened to a few lines once I understand JavaScript a lot better. It works for now and should be easy to understand at least.

The original task just tested using uppercase but I've added in some code to translate from lowercase too.

At some point I'll add, into the HTML, some options of words and phrases in ROT13 to test with.

I think it'd be good to add a feature that works in reverse to this too, i.e. converting a regular phrase into ROT13. This is something I can do in future as well as refactoring my existing code.
